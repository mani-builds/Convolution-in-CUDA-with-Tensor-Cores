* Two week plan
Start: Jan 31
Week 1: 
Day 1: Implemented 3D convolutions

Day 2: Monitor existing programs using Nsight, then use cuBLAS

Day 3: cutlass, cuTE lecture

Implement im2col
Implement GEMM with WMMA
Test: Use MNIST or synthetic data. Verify against NumPy convolve.
Profile: Nsight for bottlenecks (e.g., add kernel fusion if loads are slow).
End: Feb 14
